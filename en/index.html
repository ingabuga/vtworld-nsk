          Passion for the theater of Svetlana Mitina can hardly be called a hobby. To enter the stage, even in a small role, professional acting training is required. And although Svetlana believes that she is still in the "stage nursery", the studio has already given her incredible wealth: the opportunity for creative self-expression.

      <p class="text__question">— The history of the theater studio in your life. Was it a dream from childhood or did it all happen by chance?</p>
      <p class="text__body">— Although I liked the theater since childhood, I came to the studio quite by accident. I&nbsp;was a shy child, but I loved making up stories and making home plays based on them. At the age of 12, she wrote a script for a New Year's fairy tale, which was successfully played in my living room at home. There were even "field tours" to a girlfriend's apartment. In the fifth grade, I decided to go to the school theater studio, but ... it didn’t work out. She quit after a couple of months. Then I came to the conclusion that the acting profession will not feed. In addition, there is huge competition in this area, out of a thousand graduates of theater universities, only a few become successful. I decided to enter the prestigious Faculty of Economics.
      </p>
      <p class="text__body">And in 2012 I learned that there is a theater school for adults under the guidance of the famous Novosibirsk director Sergei Afanasyev. Signed up right there. But...not finished. Because I was just getting a second higher education on the job. I made a choice again in favor of study and work.
      </p>
      <p class="text__body">— However, the scene did not let me go. I constantly read on the Internet about amateur studios in Novosibirsk, quietly rejoicing that every year there are more and more of them. I even signed up once for an audition at the South Pole studio, but changed my mind at the last moment. I understood that I would choose a job again, and classes in the studio would not fit into my busy schedule.
      </p>
      <p class="text__body">Everything changed when I moved to live in a house near Birch Grove. I suddenly realized that the same "South Pole" is now within walking distance from me. I thought it was now or never. And now for the second year I have been doing acting, participating in shows. While I'm still a "kindergartener" who knows almost nothing. But I feel that I am growing and gradually changing. The most difficult thing is to admit to myself: yes, I can and I can be on stage!

      <p  class="text__question">— Stage fright. Is this a myth or is it true? How to overcome?
      </p>
      <p class="text__body">— Of course it's true. Even professional actors are afraid to go on stage. Every time before the performance such a state .... Well, horror! How to overcome? Think about your role, focus on the work that needs to be done. You go on stage, and in your head you only think that here you need to take so many steps, then keep such and such a rhythm, you need to answer your partner in such and such a way, and all this with an internal monologue. Even in the part when you have no lines, you still participate in what is happening.

        You must have your own assessment of what is happening, an understanding of what your partners are doing. You can’t make a mistake, because you will let the whole team down. The performance is not a movie, you can’t do a double yet. You won’t tell the viewer, “but we did better in rehearsals!”. No, you need to give 100 percent in the moment. And when you understand this, there is no time to be afraid, the fear goes away. It is assumed that before the performance and after it, the hands are trembling, the knees are shaking. But while you're on stage, you need to be as focused as possible.
      </p>
      <p  class="text__question">— How long does this hobby take you? Are daily classes required or not?
      </p>
      <p class="text__body">— Classes in the studio are held twice a week for three hours. I understand that in order to become a good actor, you need to devote your whole life to the theater, otherwise nothing will come of it. This is just a hobby for me, so I don’t go to the theater every day.
      </p>
      <p class="text__question">— Have you ever wanted to change everything? Are there cases when people left their main profession and built an acting career?
      </p>
      <p class="text__body">— It would be a lie if I said that I never thought about it. But, if you go back, I would again choose a profession and economics. For me, my main specialty is important, and I have the opportunity to express myself. I am free to choose what interests me, and this is priceless.
      </p>
      <p class="text__body">The fate of the studio members is different. There are those who eventually enter theatrical universities. One of my acquaintances, a programmer in his main specialty, last year entered the NSTI at the directing department. I know other examples when people leave the amateur theater to study professional acting. Opportunities are always there, the main thing is to determine how much time and effort you are willing to invest in achieving your dreams.

      <p  class="text__question">— What did theater give you? What skills are useful in life?
      </p>
      <p class="text__body">— For me, the stage, I repeat, is a way of self-realization. That's life. Every second art "here and now". On the one hand, it may look like an escape from reality. But on the other - a parallel, important "living" on the stage. The theater helps me. Here I grow, change, try on different situations and other people's lives.
      </p>
      <p  class="text__body">An integral part of the acting profession is the skill of movement and speech. If you do not know how to move and control your body, then the illusion collapses, the viewer will not believe you. You need to be able to control your voice so that it does not stop and sound. It is important to learn how to breathe correctly. Obviously, these skills will be useful not only on stage, but also in everyday life, especially for those who often perform in public. And the theater is a collective work and you need to work a lot in a team. To feel your partners so that in a critical situation the viewer does not notice that something did not go according to plan.

      <p  class="text__question">— Who would you like to play?
      </p>
      <p class="text__body tetx__body-first">— I just want to play a lot, a variety of roles. I realized that it is very interesting to play roles and characters that contradict my inner “I” and are not characteristic of me in life. Because it is necessary to work hard on such images, to justify more, to reincarnate more deeply. It's an exciting process.
      </p>
      <p class="text__body">I sincerely advise everyone to try acting. Even if you are not carried away by fictional characters, then mindfulness, the ability to control your body, voice, memory development, reaction speed, teamwork - all these skills will develop in you on a completely new level.
